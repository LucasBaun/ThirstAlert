# Thirst-Alert
## Overview of the project
**Lucas Baunsgaard | lb224rw**

The ThirstAlert system uses a soil moisture sensor connected to an IoT platform to monitor and report the moisture levels in the soil. When the moisture level drops below a certain threshold, the system sends a notification to alert you that it's time to water your plants. This project is the result of an IoT course at Linnaeus University (LNU) in Sweden.

***Time to complete:*** <br>
Approximately X-X hours, depending on your experience with IoT and electronics.

## Objective
### Project idea and purpose
The selection of this project was driven by a desire to explore the functionality of soil moisture sensors and their integration within a home automation system. The intention was to create a solution that bridges the gap between traditional plant care methods and modern IoT technologies. The project was chosen based on its potential to offer practical insights into the implementation of IoT devices in everyday scenarios.
<br>
The primary objective of this project is to develop a system capable of autonomously monitoring the soil moisture levels of plants and providing timely notifications for watering. The purpose is to establish an efficient and reliable method for plant care management that mitigates the risk of over or under-watering, thereby promoting plant health and longevity.
### Insights
Through the execution of this project, it is expected to gain valuable insights into the technical aspects of IoT device integration, sensor calibration, and data interpretation. Furthermore, the project aims to provide a deeper understanding of the role of technology in optimizing plant care routines. The anticipated insights encompass both practical knowledge related to hardware implementation and conceptual understanding of the synergy between IoT and agriculture.
